- There are two variables called `flags3`: G+DOS' ($3ACF) and
  Interface 1's (IY+124), but it seems their usage is different.
  Confirm it.
- Check `ufia1.nstr1` used as `prog_num1`. Example: `ld
  a,(ufia1.nstr1)     ;2BFE; Save 'DIR_DESCR1' into 'PROG_NUM1'.`
- Check relation between `internal_stack` and $3FEA.
- Label Interface 1's system variables, from address 23734.
