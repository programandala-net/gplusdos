The goal of this project is to convert the
http://www.biehold.nl/rudy/plusd/plusd.htm[disassembly of the Plus D
interface, done by JRB], from HTML into a single source code file more
suitable for studying and editing it with the Vim editor.

== History

2016-03-05:: Copied the the original HTML files, renamed them after
their initial ROM addresses, and converted them to one single text
file with the help of Arno Unkrig's `html2text`.
