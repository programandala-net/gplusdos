= G+DOS _Disassembled_
:revdate: 2017-03-07
:author: Marcos Cruz (programandala.net)

G+DOS is a disk operating system for ZX Spectrum and ZX Spectrum 128.
It was written by Bruce Gordon, from MGT (Miles Gordon Technology), in
1987-1988, for the MGT's Plus D interface.

The goal of this project is to convert the
http://www.biehold.nl/rudy/plusd/plusd.htm[disassembly of G+DOS (by
Rudy Biesma, 2005)], from HTML to a complete Z80 source suitable for
studying, editing and reassembling, in order to improve the G+DOS
support of http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.html[Solo
Forth] (http://github.com/programandala-net/solo-forth[Solo Fortht in
GitHub]).

== Tools used

- Arno Unkrig's http://www.mbayer.de/html2text/files.shtml[html2text]
for the first conversion.
- Bram Moolenaar's http://vim.org/[Vim] for the rest.

== History

The project started on 2016-03-05.
