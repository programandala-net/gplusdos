The goal of this project is to convert the
http://www.biehold.nl/rudy/plusd/plusd.htm[disassembly of the Plus D
interface, done by JRB], from HTML into a single source code file more
suitable for studying and editing it with the Vim editor.

== History

2016-03-05::

- Copied the original HTML files, renamed them after their initial ROM
  addresses, and converted them to one single text file with the help
  of Arno Unkrig's `html2text`.
- Converted routine titles and descriptions to Z80 assembler comments.
- Fixed the splitted lines.
- Changed the notation of hex numbers.
- Added semicolon to line code comments.
- Removed hex numbers used in the HTML links, leave just the labels.
- Renamed some labels which used illegal characters.

2016-03-06::

- Added DFCA, UFIA1 and UFIA2.
- Moved the assembling addresses to the line comments, thus getting an
  actual Z80 source.
